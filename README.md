# GEV
Generalised Extreme Value Distribution

analysis to produce information on the number of samples required to
accurately compute a return period.

Trying to write a paper on the topic.

gev1.py   iterative solves for a GEV for different sample sizes

gev_plot.py makes some generic plots

fit.py - my playing with least squares fit to the data but failed

fit2.py - command callable DL script to fit the data

ifit.py - iterative script to cycle through multiple DL setups 
and fit the data

fit_lib.py - module for fitting tools for the GEV problem
